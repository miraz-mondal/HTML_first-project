<font color="white"><p>Sports photography refers to the genre of photography that covers all types of sports.</p></font>

<font color="white"><p>In the majority of cases, professional sports photography is a branch of photojournalism, while amateur sports photography, such as photos of children playing association football, is a branch of vernacular photography.</p></font>

<font color="white"><p>The main application of professional sports photography is for editorial purposes; dedicated sports photographers usually work for newspapers, major wire agencies or dedicated sports magazines. However, sports photography is also used for advertising purposes both to build a brand and as well as to promote a sport in a way that cannot be accomplished by editorial means.</p></font>
