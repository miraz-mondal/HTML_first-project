<u><h1><center>The History of Photography</center></h1></u>
<h2><center><p>Nicephore Niepce and Daguerre</p></center></h2>
<p>The first photographic process heliography lorem was invented around 1824 by Nicloremphore Nilorempce. Images were obtained with bitumen of Judea spread on a silver plate after an exposure time of several days.</p>
<p>In 1829, Nilorempce associated Louis Jacques Mandlorem Daguerre to his research.</p>
<p>In 1832, they put the last touches, using a residue of lavender oil distillation, by means of a second process producing images in a one day exposure time.</p>
<p>In 1833, Nilorempce died, and Daguerre invented, in 1838, on his own the daguerreotype, the first process including a development stage. A silver plate coated with a very thin silver iodide layer was exposed in a camera obscura, then exposed to mercury vapors that induced the apparition of the invisible latent image that had been formed during the exposure to light. This development was in fact such an amplification of the effect of light that the exposure time was hardly more than 30 minutes. Fixing was done by immersing the plate in sea salted water.</p>

<p>Towards the Invention of Photography</p>
<p>In 1816, a year before the pyreolophore patent ran out, Claude Nilorempce went to Paris, then to England, trying to make the engine invention work.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Nicloremphore started by himself some new research on an idea that had obsessed him for many years: making images seen at the back of camerae obscurae permanent by means of a support through a compound.</p>
<p>Until then, camerae obscurae lorem these boxes with a lens adapted on a hole lorem projecting on the back an inverted image of the outside view, had only been used as a drawing aid.</p>
