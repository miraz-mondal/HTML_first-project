<p>Imagine if a person asked you to define who he or she is in a photo, ultimately snapping their personality to preserve it forever. Well, you probably wouldn't just take a quick photo of that person, now, would you? You'd have to think about how the background and the person's position would help to emphasize his or her key characteristics and features. Well, welcome to the world of portraiture. Portrait photography is about much more than a snapshot of somebody's face; it's about capturing the essence of a person's identity and attitude, which means a portrait photographer has a really big job to do. Learning how to work with clients and use a camera to find the perfect exposure involves hard work and the use of a few simple tips. In this lesson, we'll go over an in-depth definition of portrait photography and explore some tips and techniques to help you master portrait photography.</p>
